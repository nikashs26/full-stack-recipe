# Vegetarian Filter Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When clicking the vegetarian filter on the search page, not all vegetarian recipes were being returned. This was because the dietary restrictions filtering logic was only checking the `dietaryRestrictions` and `diets` arrays, but many recipes have the `vegetarian` boolean field set to `true` instead of (or in addition to) these arrays.

## Root Cause
The dietary restrictions filtering logic in `backend/services/recipe_cache_service.py` was missing the check for boolean fields:
- `vegetarian: true` 
- `vegan: true`

These boolean fields are commonly used in recipe data structures, especially for recipes imported from external APIs or manually created recipes.

## Files Modified
1. **`backend/services/recipe_cache_service.py`** - Fixed two instances of dietary restrictions filtering:
   - Line ~346: Filter applied when no search terms are provided
   - Line ~864: Filter applied during search result processing

## Changes Made
For each dietary restrictions filter, added the following logic:

```python
# Check dietaryRestrictions and diets arrays
if recipe.get('dietaryRestrictions'):
    recipe_dietary.extend([d.lower() for d in recipe['dietaryRestrictions'] if d])
if recipe.get('diets'):
    recipe_dietary.extend([d.lower() for d in recipe['diets'] if d])

# Check vegetarian and vegan boolean fields
if recipe.get('vegetarian') is True:
    recipe_dietary.append('vegetarian')
if recipe.get('vegan') is True:
    recipe_dietary.append('vegan')
```

## What This Fixes
- **Before**: Recipes with `vegetarian: true` but empty `dietaryRestrictions` arrays were excluded from vegetarian filter results
- **After**: All recipes with `vegetarian: true` are now properly included, regardless of whether they have populated arrays

## Testing
Created and ran a test script that verified the fix works correctly for various recipe data formats:
- Recipes with only boolean fields
- Recipes with only array fields  
- Recipes with both boolean and array fields
- Recipes with no dietary information

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Consistency**: Consider standardizing recipe data structure to always include both boolean fields and arrays
2. **Performance**: The fix adds minimal overhead (just two boolean checks per recipe)
3. **Extensibility**: The same pattern can be applied to other boolean dietary fields if needed (e.g., `glutenFree`, `dairyFree`)

## Related Code
- Frontend normalization in `src/pages/RecipesPage.tsx` already handles boolean fields correctly
- Recipe service in `backend/services/recipe_service.py` already sets boolean fields correctly
- The fix ensures backend filtering matches frontend expectations

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
1. Start the backend server
2. Go to the search page
3. Click the vegetarian filter
4. Verify that all vegetarian recipes are now returned, including those with only boolean fields
