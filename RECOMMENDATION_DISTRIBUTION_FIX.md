# Recommendation Distribution Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The recommendations section on the homepage was only recommending recipes from one cuisine at a time, despite the backend finding recipes from all chosen cuisines. This was caused by a bug in the round-robin distribution logic.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the round-robin distribution algorithm in `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`. The code had two instances of the same bug:

1. **Backend recommendations processing** (around line 520)
2. **Frontend fallback filtering** (around line 890)

### The Bug
The original code was incrementing `cuisineIndex` inside the inner loop:

```typescript
// BUGGY CODE (before fix)
for (let i = 0; i < cuisines.length && finalRecommendations.length < targetCount; i++) {
  const cuisine = cuisines[cuisineIndex % cuisines.length];
  // ... process recipe ...
  cuisineIndex++; // ❌ This was inside the inner loop!
}
```

This caused the algorithm to skip cuisines and not distribute recipes evenly across all selected cuisines.

## What Was Happening
1. User selects multiple cuisines (e.g., Italian, Indian, Mexican)
2. Backend correctly finds recipes from all selected cuisines
3. Frontend recommendation logic processes these recipes
4. **Bug**: Round-robin distribution algorithm skips cuisines due to incorrect index increment
5. **Result**: Recommendations end up being dominated by only one or two cuisines

## The Fix
Changed the round-robin logic to use a proper round-based approach:

```typescript
// FIXED CODE (after fix)
let round = 0;

while (finalRecommendations.length < targetCount && added) {
  added = false;
  
  // Go through each cuisine in order for this round
  for (let i = 0; i < cuisines.length && finalRecommendations.length < targetCount; i++) {
    const cuisine = cuisines[i]; // Use direct index, not modulo
    // ... process recipe ...
  }
  
  round++; // ✅ Increment round counter outside the inner loop
}
```

## What This Fixes
- **Before**: Recommendations were dominated by one cuisine, ignoring user's multiple cuisine preferences
- **After**: Recommendations now properly distribute recipes across all selected cuisines in a balanced way

## How It Works Now
1. **Round 1**: Take 1 recipe from each selected cuisine (if available)
2. **Round 2**: Take another recipe from each cuisine (if available)
3. **Continue**: Until target count is reached or no more recipes available

This ensures that if a user selects Italian, Indian, and Mexican cuisines, they'll get a balanced mix of recipes from all three cuisines rather than just one.

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Fixed two instances of the round-robin distribution bug

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Go to user preferences and select multiple cuisines
2. Return to homepage
3. Check that recommendations show recipes from all selected cuisines
4. Verify the distribution is balanced (not dominated by one cuisine)

## Related Code
The fix ensures that the frontend recommendation logic properly utilizes the backend's ability to find recipes from multiple cuisines, giving users a diverse and balanced set of recipe recommendations that match their preferences.
