# Fair Distribution Example

## How the New System Works

### User Preferences
- **Favorite Cuisines**: Italian, Mexican, Indian
- **Favorite Foods**: Chicken, Pasta, Tacos
- **Requested Limit**: 8 recipes

### System Allocation

#### Phase 1: Reserve Favorite Food Slots
```
Total Limit: 8 recipes
Favorite Food Slots: 2 recipes (25% of 8)
Remaining for Cuisines: 6 recipes
```

#### Phase 2: Equal Cuisine Distribution
```
3 Cuisines × 2 recipes each = 6 recipes
├── Italian: 2 recipes
├── Mexican: 2 recipes
└── Indian: 2 recipes
```

### Final Result
```
Total: 8 recipes
├── Favorite Foods: 2 recipes
│   ├── Chicken Pasta (Italian) - Favorite food in preferred cuisine
│   └── Tacos (Mexican) - Favorite food in preferred cuisine
└── Cuisine Distribution: 6 recipes
    ├── Italian: 2 recipes (1 favorite + 1 regular)
    ├── Mexican: 2 recipes (1 favorite + 1 regular)
    └── Indian: 2 recipes (0 favorite + 2 regular)
```

## Why This is Fair

1. **Equal Representation**: Each cuisine gets exactly 2 recipes
2. **Favorite Food Guarantee**: At least 2 favorite foods are included
3. **No Domination**: No single cuisine can dominate the results
4. **Predictable**: Same preferences always produce same distribution

## Different Limit Examples

### Limit: 6 recipes
```

├── Mexican: 1 recipe
└── Indian: 2 recipes (gets the extra slot)
```

### Limit: 12 recipes
```
