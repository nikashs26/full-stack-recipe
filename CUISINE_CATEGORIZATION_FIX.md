# Cuisine Categorization Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When selecting multiple cuisines (e.g., Greek and American), the homepage recommendations were showing all recipes as "Unknown" cuisine, even though the backend was correctly returning recipes with the `cuisines` array populated.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the cuisine categorization logic in `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`. The code was looking for the `cuisine` field (which was `undefined`) instead of using the `cuisines` array that actually contained the cuisine data.

### The Bug
```typescript
// ❌ BUGGY CODE (before fix)
const cuisine = recipe.cuisine || 'Unknown'; // recipe.cuisine was undefined
```

### What Was Happening
1. User selects Greek and American cuisines
2. Backend correctly finds and returns recipes from both cuisines
3. Backend populates the `cuisines` array: `{Greek: 20, Moroccan: 1}`
4. **Bug**: Frontend looks for `recipe.cuisine` field (undefined)
5. **Result**: All recipes categorized as "Unknown" cuisine
6. **Final Result**: Recommendations show 8 recipes all from "Unknown" cuisine

## The Fix
Changed the cuisine categorization logic to use the `cuisines` array when available:

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED CODE (after fix)
// Categorize by cuisine - use cuisines array if available, fallback to cuisine field
let cuisine = 'Unknown';
if (Array.isArray(recipe.cuisines) && recipe.cuisines.length > 0) {
  // Use the first cuisine from the array
  cuisine = recipe.cuisines[0];
} else if (recipe.cuisine) {
  cuisine = recipe.cuisine;
}
```

## What This Fixes
- **Before**: All recipes categorized as "Unknown" cuisine, ignoring user's cuisine preferences
- **After**: Recipes properly categorized by their actual cuisine (Greek, American, etc.)

## How It Works Now
1. **Priority 1**: Check if `recipe.cuisines` array exists and has content
2. **Priority 2**: Use the first cuisine from the array (e.g., "Greek")
3. **Fallback**: If no cuisines array, fall back to `recipe.cuisine` field
4. **Default**: If neither exists, use "Unknown"

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Fixed three instances of cuisine categorization logic:
  - Line ~304: Frontend fallback filtering
  - Line ~457: Backend recommendations processing
  - Line ~523: Additional categorization logic

## Expected Results After Fix
When you select Greek and American cuisines:
1. **Backend**: Returns recipes with `cuisines: ["Greek"]` or `cuisines: ["American"]`
2. **Frontend**: Properly categorizes recipes by their actual cuisine
3. **Recommendations**: Show balanced mix of Greek and American recipes
4. **Distribution**: No more "Unknown" cuisine recipes

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Go to user preferences and select multiple cuisines (e.g., Greek and American)
2. Return to homepage
3. Check that recommendations now show recipes from the actual selected cuisines
4. Verify that no recipes are categorized as "Unknown" cuisine

## Related Issues
This fix works in conjunction with the previous recommendation distribution fix to ensure:
1. ✅ Recipes are properly categorized by cuisine
2. ✅ Recommendations are balanced across all selected cuisines
3. ✅ User preferences are properly reflected in the homepage

The combination of both fixes should now give you properly balanced recommendations from all your selected cuisines! 🎉
