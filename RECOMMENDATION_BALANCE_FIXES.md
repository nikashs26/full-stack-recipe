# Recipe Recommendations Cuisine Distribution Fix

## Problem Description

The recipe recommendations system was only returning recipes from one cuisine instead of providing a balanced distribution across all user-selected cuisine preferences. This was causing users to see recommendations that didn't reflect their diverse culinary interests.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `RecipeSearchService.get_recipe_recommendations()` method in `backend/services/recipe_search_service.py`. The problem had two main components:

### 1. Incomplete `if` Statements (Syntax Error)
There were incomplete `if` statements in the recipe cache service that were causing Python syntax errors:
- Line 584: Missing body for `if query_lower in ingredients_text:`
- Line 590: Missing body for `if query_lower in field_text:`

### 2. Cuisine Field Handling Mismatch
The recommendation logic was only checking the `cuisine` field, but many recipes in the database have:
- Empty `cuisine` fields (`''`)
- Populated `cuisines` arrays (e.g., `['italian']`, `['indian']`)

This mismatch meant that recipes with cuisine information in the `cuisines` array were being ignored, severely limiting the available recipes for each cuisine preference.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Syntax Errors in Recipe Cache Service
```python
# Before (incomplete if statements)
if query_lower in ingredients_text:


# After (complete if statements with proper bodies)
if query_lower in ingredients_text:
    logger.debug(f"  - ⚠️ Query '{query_lower}' found in ingredients, but this is name search - ignoring")
```

### 2. Enhanced Cuisine Extraction Logic
Updated the cuisine extraction to check both fields in order of priority:

```python
# Check both cuisine and cuisines fields for cuisine information
recipe_cuisine = None

# First try the cuisine field
if recipe.get('cuisine'):
    recipe_cuisine = self._normalize_cuisine(recipe.get('cuisine', ''), recipe)

# If no cuisine field, check the cuisines array
if not recipe_cuisine and recipe.get('cuisines'):
    cuisines_array = recipe.get('cuisines', [])
    if isinstance(cuisines_array, list) and cuisines_array:
        # Use the first cuisine from the array
        recipe_cuisine = self._normalize_cuisine(cuisines_array[0], recipe)

# If still no cuisine, try to detect from ingredients
if not recipe_cuisine:
    recipe_cuisine = self._detect_cuisine_from_ingredients(recipe)
```

### 3. Fixed Cuisine Counting Logic
Updated all cuisine counting operations to check both fields:

```python
# Before (only checking cuisine field)
c_count = len([r for r in final_recommendations if r.get('cuisine', '').lower() == c.lower()])

# After (checking both fields)
c_count = 0
for r in final_recommendations:
    recipe_cuisine = r.get('cuisine', '').lower()
    recipe_cuisines = r.get('cuisines', [])
    
    # Check both cuisine and cuisines fields
    if recipe_cuisine == c.lower():
        c_count += 1
    elif isinstance(recipe_cuisines, list):
        for cuisine_item in recipe_cuisines:
            if cuisine_item and cuisine_item.lower() == c.lower():
                c_count += 1
                break
```

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/services/recipe_cache_service.py`**
   - Fixed incomplete `if` statements around lines 584-590
   - Added proper error handling and logging

2. **`backend/services/recipe_search_service.py`**
   - Enhanced cuisine extraction in `get_recipe_recommendations()`
   - Fixed cuisine counting logic throughout the method
   - Updated both Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the recommendation algorithm

## Testing

### 1. Syntax Fix Verification
The syntax errors have been resolved and the backend should now start without errors.

### 2. Cuisine Extraction Test
Created `test_recommendations_fix.py` to verify the cuisine extraction logic works with different recipe formats:
- ✅ Recipes with `cuisine` field only
- ✅ Recipes with `cuisines` array only  
- ✅ Recipes with both fields
- ✅ Recipes with neither field (fallback to ingredient detection)

### 3. Recommendations Logic Test
Verified that the cuisine counting logic now properly handles both field types and maintains balanced distribution.

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, the recommendations system should:

1. **Return balanced cuisine distribution**: If a user selects Italian, Indian, and Mexican cuisines, they should get roughly equal numbers of recipes from each cuisine.

2. **Utilize all available recipes**: Recipes with cuisine information in the `cuisines` array will now be properly recognized and included in recommendations.

3. **Maintain fair allocation**: The system will still respect the fair distribution algorithm that ensures each preferred cuisine gets its allocated number of recipe slots.

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### 2. Set User Preferences
Ensure a user has multiple cuisine preferences set (e.g., Italian, Indian, Mexican).

### 3. Call Recommendations Endpoint
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     "http://localhost:5003/api/recommendations?limit=8"
```

### 4. Verify Cuisine Distribution
Check that the response contains recipes from multiple cuisines with roughly equal distribution.

## Monitoring

The system now includes enhanced logging that will show:
- Cuisine distribution in search results
- Current status after processing each cuisine
- Final cuisine distribution in recommendations
- Any warnings about cuisines that couldn't reach their target count

## Future Improvements

1. **Cuisine Normalization**: Consider standardizing cuisine names across the database to ensure consistent matching.

2. **Fallback Strategies**: Implement additional fallback strategies for recipes that still can't be categorized.

3. **Performance Optimization**: The enhanced cuisine checking adds some overhead; consider caching cuisine information to improve performance.

## Conclusion

These fixes resolve the core issue where recommendations were only showing one cuisine. The system now properly handles the mixed cuisine field formats in the database and should provide balanced, diverse recipe recommendations that better reflect user preferences.
