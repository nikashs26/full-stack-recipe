      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and butter 4 small (about 200ml) ramekins. Sprinkle the Parmesan into the ramekins, turning until all sides are covered. Place the milk and bay leaves in a large saucepan over a gentle heat and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 mins.\r\nDiscard the bay leaves, add the butter and flour, and return to a low heat. Very gently simmer, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 mins until you get a smooth, thick white sauce. Make sure that you get right into the corners of the pan to stop the sauce from catching or becoming lumpy.\r\nOnce thickened, transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, cayenne pepper, Gruy\u00e8re and egg yolks until fully combined.\r\nIn a spotlessly clean bowl and with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites just until peaks begin to form.\r\nCarefully fold the egg whites into the cheese sauce in three stages making sure you fold, rather than stir, to keep the egg whites light and airy. Fill the prepared ramekins with the souffl\u00e9 mix.\r\nTop each souffl\u00e9 with a slice of goat\u2019s cheese, then place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-25 mins or until springy and well risen but cooked through.\r\nLeave to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each dish and remove the souffl\u00e9s. If preparing in advance, place souffl\u00e9s upside down (for neat presentation), on a tray. Cover tray in cling film. Chill for a few days or freeze for up to 1 month.\r\nWhen ready to re-bake, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the upside-down souffl\u00e9s in a shallow baking dish, top with the remaining goat\u2019s cheese slices and pour over the cream (this stops them from drying out when baked for the second time). Cook for 8-10 mins until golden. Serve immediately alongside some simply dressed salad."

      "\r\nFor the Lentils: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F to prepare for roasting eggplant. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, and onion and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add lentils, bay leaves, stock or water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, cover with the lid partially ajar, and cook until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. (Top up with water if lentils are at any point not fully submerged.) Remove lid, stir in vinegar, and reduce until lentils are moist but not soupy. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nFor the Eggplant: While lentils cook, cut each eggplant in half. Score flesh with the tip of a paring knife in a cross-hatch pattern at 1-inch intervals. Transfer to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, cut side up, and brush each eggplant half with 1 tablespoon oil, letting each brushstroke be fully absorbed before brushing with more. Season with salt and pepper. Place a rosemary sprig on top of each one. Transfer to oven and roast until completely tender and well charred, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and discard rosemary.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nTo Serve: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and pine nuts in a medium skillet set over medium heat. Cook, tossing nuts frequently, until golden brown and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to halt cooking. Stir half of parsley and rosemary into lentils and transfer to a serving platter. Arrange eggplant halves on top. Spread a few tablespoons of tahini sauce over each eggplant half and sprinkle with pine nuts. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and rosemary, drizzle with additional olive oil, and serve."

If you don\u2019t mix it enough it will not set well enough, but don\u2019t get impatient and whisk it really quick because that\u2019ll make it split! Spread over the biscuit base and leave to set in the fridge overnight.\r\n\r\n4) Remove the Cheesecake from the tin carefully and decorate the cheesecake \u2013 I drizzled over some of the spare caramel, and then some Toffee Popcorn and more Pretzels!"

Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; finely chop whites. Peel and finely chop garlic.\r\n\r\n2. In a medium bowl, soak bread with 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings); break up with your hands until pasty. Stir in beef, sriracha, scallion whites, half the garlic, salt (we used 3/4 tsp kosher salt; 11/2 tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves (four loaves for 4). Place on one side of a baking sheet. Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4, spread meatloaves out across whole sheet and add carrots to a second sheet.) Bake for 20 minutes (we'll glaze the meatloaves then).\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until very\r\ntender, 12-15 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain. While potatoes cook, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce, garlic powder, 1/4 cup ketchup (1/2 cup for 4 servings), and 2 tsp sugar (4 tsp for 4).\r\n\r\n4. Once meatloaves and carrots have baked 20 minutes, remove from oven. Spoon half the ketchup glaze over meatloaves (save\r\nthe rest for serving); return to oven until carrots are browned and tender, meatloaves are cooked through, and glaze is tacky, 4-5 minutes more.\r\n\r\n5. Meanwhile, melt 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in pot used for potatoes over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and cook\r\nuntil fragrant, 30 seconds. Add potatoes and 1/4 tsp wasabi. Mash, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as necessary until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (If you like things spicy, stir in more wasabi!)\r\n\r\n6. Divide meatloaves, mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots between plates. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve with remaining ketchup glaze on the side for dipping."

Cook until the tomatoes have blistered and broken down, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper and add water as necessary to thin to a saucy consistency. Meanwhile, combine the yogurt and cumin in a serving bowl.

Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.)\r\nThe finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata.

The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky. But if they do break apart, don\u2019t worry, the flavor won\u2019t suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.\r\nFinishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for",
      "minutes. Taste again for salt and pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata.\r\nPortioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person. If the shanks are gargantuan or you\u2019re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most.\r\nServing: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce \u2013 the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone\u2019s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon."

      "TO MAKE SUSHI ROLLS: Pat out some rice. Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.",
      "STEP 2",
      "Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise. Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.",
      "STEP 3",
      "Add the filling. Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings \u2013 here we\u2019ve used tuna and cucumber.",
      "STEP 4",
      "Roll it up. Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll.",
      "STEP 5",
      "Stick down the sides like a stamp. When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll.",
      "STEP 6",
      "Wrap in cling film. Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film.",
      "STEP 7",
      "TO MAKE PRESSED SUSHI: Layer over some smoked salmon. Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.",
      "STEP 8",
      "Cover with rice and press down. Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.",
      "STEP 9",
      "Tip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.",
      "STEP 10",
      "TO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.",
      "STEP 11",
      "Make into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve."

If you must make and serve it on the same day, just be sure it is  refrigerated at least 4 hours before serving.",

If you want, wedges of avocado make a nice garnish. Your ceviche will be chilled, fresh, and delicious. You can enjoy it with a glass of white wine, but my personal faves would be a Cadillac margarita, or an icy cold beer. Buen Provecho!"

      "When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.",
      "As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.",
      "When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft. If the sauce is too thick at this point, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir well to combine.",
      "Dish out the fish curry gently because the fish may flake or break up.",
      "Garnish with coriander leaves."

      "Here's a tasty Punjabi recipe for lamb chops. My folks originated from this area of the sub-continet and hence this was popular at home.",
      "Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender with 2-3 tablespoons of water and blend to a paste.",
      "Put the chops, tomatoes, onions, cayenne pepper, yoghurt, salt and ginger-garlic paste into a large wok or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir and bring to the boil. Turn the heat to low, cover and simmer for 50 minutes or until the chops are almost cooked.",
      "Add the cumin seeds and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the meat is tender and the sauce thick.",
      "Add the garam masala and lemon juice and stir.",
      "Sprinkle fresh coriander over the top and serve.TIPSIn the Punjab, tomatoes are grated to make a puree - don't be tempted to use ready-prepared tomato puree instead of fresh.The spice combinations in garam masala vary in different parts of India. In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick, 4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg.",
      "Put the coriander and the cumin into a cast-iron frying-pan over a medium heat.Stir until lightly roasted. Allow to cool. Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried paratha layered with ghee(clarified butter).Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his bread! You of course, can serve this dish with plain boiled rice."

Tip the sheet inside the oven on top rack and cook for about 22-25 minutes flipping it after 15 minutes till chicken is done but still tender.You may get some burnt marks on the chicken but thats okay!After the chicken is done,take a small bowl and light a little piece of charcoal in it.Tranfer the chicken to a big bowl and in between,place the small bowl with charcoal and cover with a aluminium foil for about 5 minutes.This will infuse the chicken with smoky flavor.Be very careful doing this.Take care that there should be no vivible flame on the charcoal piece,only fumes!",

I just knead it right in the bowl.  Stop kneading as soon as the dough comes together and is soft and not too stickydo not over knead!  Try to knead it no more than 10 times if that helps.Form a ball, place it in the center of the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm spot for 20 minutes.After 20 minutes the dough wont really look any different, dont worry about it.  Divide the dough into 8 sections and roll into balls.Re-cover the balls with the plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.On a floured surface roll the balls out, either in a round or oval shape.  Meanwhile heat an iron skillet (or just plain skillet if thats all you have) on medium-high heat.Whack the rolled out dough onto the hot skillet and cover with a lid.  In less than the time you can roll out another ball the first side will be done, check the bread, when its nice and bubbly on the raw side flip it over and cook for a few more seconds.Thats it, get it out of the pan and put it on a plate or in your mouth or whatever! yum!"

      "Add a pinch of salt and pepper or 1/4 teaspoon of Masterfoods Garlic Pepper Seasonings.",
      "At this point, taste the sauce and adjust sweetness-sour levels accordingly. If too sweet, add a little more ketchup. If too sour, add more sugar. If not salty enough, add more salt+pepper. Different brands of oyster sauce and ketchup will affect this, so a taste test is a must.",
      "Once the sauce is ready, add the cooked chicken back to the sauce and toss evenly. The sauce should just gently coat the chicken without soaking it and making it soggy.",

Set the bowl upside down on a plate; the fried rice should sit upright in a round shape. Enjoy with kimchi and other banchan (side dishes).",

For fried rice, this can be skipped since the main point is to get them slightly tender; this means cooking the harder veggies (carrots) first and adding the softer ones (onions) later.

Depending on the size of the chicken breasts, this could take anywhere from 15 - 20 minutes.While the chicken is boiling, put together your sauce.",

If you're worried about the cashews getting too soft, you could add them right before serving!After the chicken is done boiling, I like to let it rest for about 5 minutes. This ensures that the juice stays in the chicken instead of spilling out when you cut it!Dice up the chicken and mix it into the sauce.",

This way I can keep them in longer to assure that the insides are cooked without browning them on top, which happened with a batch that was drier / baked higher.",
      "Bake in fully preheated oven for 5 minutes, turn the pan, and bake for around 8 minutes more, or until the feet of the macaron are a bit sturdier than soft.Cool on sheets for two minutes, then remove to rack to cool completely.Fill with prepared lemon curd and refrigerate to harden.",

Set your ramekins into a lasagna pan or roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough water so that the water level is half the way up the sides of the ramekins. Too much more, and you run the risk of water sneaking into your custards, and we don't want that. This is your bain-marie, or water bath, in which you will cook the custards for 55 minutes to one hour, until a knife inserted into the custard emerges clean. Carefully remove the bain-marie from the oven - we don't want any splashing on the exit from the oven, either - and allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. The custards may be served warm or at"

Swirl the mould gently to evenly distribute the caramel to coat the mould. Make sure not to burn the caramel as this would make it bitter. A pale brown color is what you should achieve. Set each aside to cool down.Making the Custard:In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients namely the egg yolks, vanilla extract, white sugar, condense and evaporated milk. Make sure you include as little egg white as possible to the mixture. This will make your flan creamier and bubble-free.Use a whisk to mix the ingredients thoroughly, making sure the sugar has been completely dissolved.",
      "Pour the mixture in the moulds. Fill each up at least just half high as the mould, because the mixture is expected to expand once it's steamed.Cover each mould with an aluminum foil to avoid the moisture from the steam to come in contact with the flan. This will cause it to become watery.Steam cook for around an hour at steady heat. It is essential that you do not change the amount of heat as this might cause uneven cooking.Check every now and then whether the flan is already ready or not, with the use of a fork. Just gently poke the flan with the fork and you will know it's ready if nothing sticks to the fork as you pull it out.Once you achieve this, remove the moulds from the steamer right away and let it cool at room temperature. Avoid overcooking the flan as this will make it hard and dry.Once the flans have cooled down, refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.Upon Serving:Unmould the Leche Flan by running a knife around the edge of the mould, carefully inverting it onto a serving dish, allowing the caramelized sugar coat the flan.",

You can find it at your local craft store in the cake and candy making section. Mine was $1.49, so not too big of an investment. You can also just pipe them out by just cutting a corner from your bag. You simply won't have the classic star shape that you usually see associated with churros.Grab a fryer if you have it, or simply grab a large pan and fill it with about 1\" of cooking oil. Turn your heat on medium high and give it a good five or so minutes to heat up.Once your oil is good and hot, you can start piping your churros into the oil.

Once the dough turns nice brown, you are ready to pipe the churros in.Pipe the dough directly into the hot oil (choose any length you like) and cut with a fork (I found a fork to be the best tool for this). Do not pipe too many churros in as they need space for frying. It will take only about 2 minutes for them to get nice golden color and that is a sign they are ready.

      "Sprinkle remaining 1 cup of sea salt onto the leaves of the cabbages before soaking them in the salt water. Cabbages should be partially submerged in the salt water.",
      "Let sit for a minimum 6 hours but 12 hours is preferred.",
      "Once finished soaking, rinse the cabbage leaves thoroughly under cold water several times.",
      "Remove water from the cabbage by giving them a squeeze (they should have a rubbery texture by now) to remove excess water. Set in a colander or basket for at least 2 hours so the water will drain out thoroughly. Meanwhile, prepare the red pepper mixture to be mixed with cabbage leaves.",
      "Prepare 3 tbsp of the sweet rice flour with 3 cups of water into a small pot. Bring to a boil and whisk until the mixture turns into a glue-like consistency.",
      "Let cool and set aside.",
      "In a food processor, puree onion, garlic, ginger and some water until smooth.",
      "Pour gochugaru (chili flakes) in a large mixing bowl, add the garlic mixture puree, cooled rice glue, fish sauce, salted shrimp, sugar, and sesame seeds.",
      "Mix well and add the sliced radish and green onions.",
      "Lather each cabbage piece with red pepper mixture by rubbing them well (rubber gloves highly recommended). Continue until all the cabbage leaves are covered in the red pepper mixture. Pack them inside air-tight glass jars/containers.  Set out at room temperature for 2 days for fermentation to take place. After that, place in the refrigerator and serve as needed. The kimchi may keep for 2 or 3 months in the refrigerator.*Making kimchi is not easy, but if done right, the rewards are endless. You can take the easy way out and purchase them at your local Korean grocery store and even possibly in the Asian foods section of your local grocery."

When ready, serve as a side dish (banchan) with the main dish.*This particular side dish (along with regular gim, seaweed) is perfect with a bowl of rice. Many Koreans (with chopsticks in hand) simply wrap a single leaf around some rice and indulge in its deliciousness. The salty and sour perilla leaves with the sticky rice really go great together."

      "Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!"

Bring the broth to a boil.While the chili is cooking, remove the rough stem from the collard green leaves. Chop them into strips.Once the chili has boiled, add the beans and chopped collards. Chop the tofu in half, and crumble each half with your hands. I did this right over the boiling pot. Be careful of hot liquids splashing out!Season with the salt and boil for another 5-10 minutes, or until the potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork.Turn off the heat and serve the chili with some ground pepper.Store any leftovers in an airtight container."

      "Massage mustard sauce into the meat. Wrap the meat tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 3 days. (The sauce was really thin and liquid-y so after dumping about half on the meat and realizing massaging was just not going to happen, I threw the meat and the sauce into a ziplock bag, shook it up and made sure it was coated then threw it in the fridge for the three day marinating marathon.)At least one hour prior to cooking, remove the roast from the refrigerator and unwrap, placing the meat and the marinating juices into a disposable 913 disposable aluminum pan and let it come to room temperature. (As I mentioned above, my pans were a bit flimsy so I doubled up.) Soak the wood chips in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain.Meanwhile, light a large chimney starter filled halfway with charcoal (about 3 quarts) and allow to burn until the coals are partially covered with a layer of ash. Build a modified two-level fire by arranging all the coals over half of the grill, leaving the other half empty. Open the bottom grill vents completely.",
      "Place the wood chips on the coals. Set the cooking grate in place, cover and heat the grate until hot, about 5 minutes. Use a grill brush to scrape the cooking grate clean. Sip a wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding the wad with tongs, oil the cooking grate.Set the aluminum pan with the roast on the grate opposite the coals. Open the grill lid vents three-quarters of the way and cover, making sure the vent is above the meat to draw smoke through the grill. Cook, adding about eight briquettes every hour or so to maintain an average temperature of 275F for three hours. (When I added coals, I also basted the marinade over the roast to ensure moistness.)Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325F. Wrap the pan holding the roast, being careful not to spill the marinating liquid, with heavy duty aluminum foil to cover completely.",
      "Place the pan in the oven and cook until the meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.Carefully slide the foil-wrapped pan with the roast into a brown paper bag. Crimp the end shut.",
      "Let rest for 1 hour. (I found it easiest to lay the paper bag open on its side and slide the roast in, instead of dropping it downward, then folding the opening up and taping it shut.)While roast is resting, prepare barbecue sauce. If wanting true South Carolina style barbecue sauce, make the marinade above. If wanting a thicker, tangier sauce with a hot finish, I highly recommend Inas barbecue sauce below. Its a bit of an ingredient dump with 11 of 13 items being from jars and bottles, but with flavors so loud and clamoring for your taste-buds attention, you wont regret it.In a large sauce pan on low heat, saute onions and garlic with the oil until the onions are translucent, about 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "Add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer uncovered on low heat for 30 minutes. Use immediately or store in fridge. Makes about 6 cups.Keeping: This sauce freezes excellently. I made a big batch last fall and froze it, pulling it out for the pulled pork. I re-heated in a sauce pan on low heat until hot.Once pork has rested, transfer the roast to a carving board and dispose of the marinade liquid and pan. When cool enough to handle, separate the roast into sections, removing fat if desired, and tear the meat into shreds with your fingers (forks work just as well without your fingers getting messy).",
      "Place the shredded meat in a large bowl. Toss with 1 cup of the barbecue sauce, adding more to taste.",
      "Serve, passing the remaining sauce separately."

Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the pur\u00e9e as possible.

      "Spoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes \u2013 or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled, so don\u2019t over-stir it. Scatter a few tiny mint leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries. Sprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits."

      "Get everything for the pudding prepared. Chop the almonds coarsely. Peel, core and chop the cooking apples. Sharpen your knife and chop the candied peel. (You can chop the almonds and apples in a food processor, but the peel must be done by hand.) Grate three quarters of the nutmeg (sounds a lot but it's correct)",
      "Mix the almonds, apples, candied peel, nutmeg, raisins, flour, breadcrumbs, light muscovado sugar, eggs and 2 tbsp brandy or cognac in a large bowl",
      "Holding the butter in its wrapper, grate a quarter of it into the bowl, then stir everything together. Repeat until all the butter is grated, then stir for 3-4 mins \u2013 the mixture is ready when it subsides slightly after each stir. Ask the family to stir too, and get everyone to make a wish",
      "Generously butter two 1.2 litre bowls and put a circle of baking parchment in the bottom of each. Pack in the pudding mixture. Cover with a double layer of baking parchment, pleating it to allow for expansion, then tie with string (keep the paper in place with a rubber band while tying). Trim off any excess paper",
      "Now stand each bowl on a large sheet of foil and bring the edges up over the top, then put another sheet of foil over the top and bring it down underneath to make a double package (this makes the puddings watertight). Tie with more string, and make a handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan. Watch our video to see how to tie up a pudding correctly",
      "Boil or oven steam the puddings for 8 hrs, topping up with water as necessary. Remove from the pans and leave to cool overnight. When cold, discard the messy wrappings and re-wrap in new baking parchment, foil and string. Store in a cool, dry place until Christmas",
      "To make the brandy butter, cream the butter with the orange zest and icing sugar. Gradually beat in the brandy or cognac and chopped stem ginger. Put in a small bowl, fork the top attractively and put in the fridge to set. The butter will keep for a week in the fridge, or it can be frozen for up to six weeks",
      "On Christmas Day, boil or oven steam for 1 hr. Unwrap and turn out. To flame, warm 3-4 tbsp brandy in a small pan, pour it over the pudding and set light to it."

Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\r\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for",

      "cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\r\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\r\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for",
      "minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander."

      "Firstly, to cook the shrimp, heat the olive oil in a pan and once hot add the shrimp crushed garlic and chili flakes. It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce.",
      "Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.",
      "Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.",
      "Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.",
      "When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper.",
      "Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp. This is great flavour, so you dont want to lose it."

Cook just until the the onion and garlic softens, about 7 minutes or so.While your veggies are cooking, chop up your kale and get it ready to go, but don't add it yet.  You don't need to worry about chopping the spinach leaves, when it comes time to add them, just use the whole leaf.Once your veggies are cooked, drain your lentils and add them and the rice to the veggies. If you can't find a black rice, just use wild rice.Give the veggies, rice and lentils a stir and then add your veggie broth, water, kale, spinach and all of the spices and turn the heat to high.Keep the burner on high just until the soup boils, reduce the heat to low and cover for 25 minutes. Covering the soup will ensure that the lentils and rice cook thoroughly.After the soup cooks covered for 25 minutes, remove the cover and continue to cook on low for another 30 minutes or so.  I added another 1/2 tsp of salt and a bit of pepper for flavoring at this point and it was a perfect balance.After the final 30 minutes of simmer, simply serve and enjoy!"

This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.",
      "Clean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called \"dead man,\" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).",
      "Before you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic",

      "Place the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove.",
      "Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor.",
      "Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.",
      "Here comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine.",
      "Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.",
      "Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot.",
      "Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now.",
      "Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.",
      "Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now.",
      "Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.",
      "Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease.",
      "Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh.",
      "Add to gumbo pot.",
      "Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended.",
      "Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.",
      "Skim any excess fat.",
      "Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.",
      "To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time."

Rinsing the spoon in cold water after every 3 balls makes forming them easier. Fry for approximately 5 minutes or until golden brown, turning to brown all sides.",

Use a tablespoon to pour separate batters into the idli moulds. As you can see in the picture I added a mustard seed on top of each idli.Once we are done with the batter, cover the idli maker with the lid and place it in a microwave.For Regular size Moulds, cook in the microwave for approx 4 minutes, and for mini-idlis's cook for ~2 minutes. Once done, wait for a couple of minutes, remove the lid & scoop out the Idli's using a  spoon or idli spatula.Piping Hot Idli's are ready to be enjoyed with homemade tomato, coconut chutneys and sambhar.... !!!"
